        <h2>What is a notary?</h2>
        <p>A notary, often referred to as a notary public, is a legally authorized and impartial officer who plays a critical role in verifying and certifying the authenticity of various documents and transactions. Notaries are typically appointed by state governments in the United States and have similar counterparts in many other countries. Their primary function is to serve as impartial witnesses to the signing of important documents, such as contracts, deeds, affidavits, and wills. Notaries ensure that the individuals signing these documents are who they claim to be and that they are doing so willingly and with full understanding of the contents. They also administer oaths and affirmations and may be involved in tasks like taking depositions and acknowledgments.</p>
        <p>In addition to witnessing signatures, notaries also affix their official seal or stamp to the documents they verify. This seal provides further evidence of the notary's authenticity and authority. Notaries are essential for preventing fraud, as their involvement adds an extra layer of credibility to important transactions. Their services are often required in real estate transactions, legal proceedings, and various business transactions to ensure the legality and validity of documents. Overall, notaries play a crucial role in upholding the integrity and reliability of documents and contracts in both personal and professional spheres.</p>

        <h2>What is an apostille?</h2>
        <p>An apostille is a specialized type of certification used in international document authentication. It is a simplified and standardized method of verifying the authenticity of a document for use in foreign countries that are part of the Hague Convention. The term "apostille" is derived from the French word for "certification," and it serves as a universally recognized seal or certificate that is affixed to a document by a designated authority. The purpose of an apostille is to confirm the validity of the document's origin, the authority of the signature, and the capacity in which the person who signed it acted. Essentially, an apostille is an official endorsement that allows a document issued in one country to be accepted as valid in another, without the need for further verification or legalization.</p>
        <p>Apostilles are commonly used for various types of documents, including birth certificates, marriage certificates, academic diplomas, notarized documents, and legal agreements. They simplify the process of cross-border transactions, such as international adoptions, marriage between individuals from different countries, and overseas business transactions. By affixing an apostille to a document, the issuing country certifies that the document is genuine and has legal standing, making it easier for individuals and organizations to use their documents abroad without the need for lengthy and often costly legalizations. This streamlined authentication process promotes international cooperation and simplifies the recognition of foreign documents, contributing to the ease of global business and personal interactions.</p>
